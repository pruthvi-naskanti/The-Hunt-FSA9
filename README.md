# The-Hunt-FSA9

## Overview 
We would like to create an app that can be played on a mobile device. The app would encourage players to complete a 'quest' by encountering a specific list of locations. 
A player would activate one of the locations in the quest. To score that location, the user must enter the geographic area. Full CRUD for locations will be implemented.

## Application Overview
There will be two colors in the application, when the user touches the first color it will request a valid location. When user touches the second color, it has two scenarios, first one if user is outside of the quest location it will help the user with the clue. If user is inside the quest location it will notify with congrats message.
